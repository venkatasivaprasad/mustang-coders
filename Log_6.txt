NEUTRAL +ve=5.000000 -ve=5.000000 Great, it is so nice to not hear the beeping from the old one..
Neutral
NEUTRAL +ve=5.000000 -ve=5.000000 I gave this item a 3 star rating only because the maker put connectors on it substantially smaller than the original battery had. This forced me to have to squeeze the connecting clips with pliers to keep them from falling off the terminals.

Positive
NEGATIVE +ve=4.000000 -ve=6.000000 I'm on my second replacement. It works good for about a year. Installation is easy, connectors fit just fine. It is also cheap. I would gladly pay more and not have to replace it every year.... the warning beep is annoying.I would give it 5 stars if I could get 2 years out of it.

Negative
POSITIVE +ve=6.000000 -ve=4.000000 This is NOT a replacement for the Set top box battery. Apparently there is a big difference between "PK" and "PX" -- the hookups are completely different. This is useless.

Negative
POSITIVE +ve=8.000000 -ve=2.000000 Received on time. Fit was fine. So far, so good.... i.e., my Set top unit 'battery' light remains out. We'll have to wait to see what kind of life I get on this battery... the original lasted close to five years
