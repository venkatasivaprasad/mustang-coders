Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
This router was a huge disapointment.
My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
