The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
I used this router to plow out 3" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.
This is an excellent router for the money.
I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.
For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
This is an excellent router for the price.
This is my second one.
The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
For the price I don't think you can beat it.
