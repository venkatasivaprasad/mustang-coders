Blazing fast internet speeds... I'm blown away 
I have been talking to 5 agents so far, still no end to my pain... phone can't be dead for 10 days!!! 
Been a loyal customer for 3 years enjoying the service, the last three months has been horrible 
Network quality is great but certainly not value for money.... I can get better deals elsewhere 
Summer is finally here 
Amazing picture quality... HD TV Rocks 
The entire ordering process was a breeze.... Loved it 
Arrived in a timely fashion. Plugged it in and it works like a charm! No more annoying beeping from the old battery. After doing some homework, we found this price extremely affordable. 
I took the day off yesterday for the installation, whole family was around and the technician did not show up. How do I cancel the service now? 
It's been a crazy day... traffic is horrible
