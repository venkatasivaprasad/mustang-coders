I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.

This router was a huge disapointment.
The depth adjustment was sloppy.
The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
