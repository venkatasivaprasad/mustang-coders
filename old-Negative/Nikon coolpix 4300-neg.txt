. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
. images taken indoor were n't so clear . 
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit 
. lens cap is a really annoying 
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card . 
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 . 
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . 
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix . 
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty ! 
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor ! 
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service . 
made the camera totally inoperable . 
also , the lens cap design is flawed . 
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it . 
audio on video also lacking . 
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either . 
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair . 
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . 
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . 
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing . 
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
